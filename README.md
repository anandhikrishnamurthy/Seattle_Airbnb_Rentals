## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using the Airbnb Seattle data from 2016 to better understand:

1. What are the major factors that influence the price of an Airbnb rental in Seattle?
2. What amenities are offered most frequently in the Airbnb rentals in Seattle?
3.  Which neighborhoods in Seattle have the highest and lowest Airbnb rental prices?
4. What are the number of Airbnb rental listings in the different neighborhoods of Seattle?
5. What are the most expensive and least expensive months for the Airbnb rentals in Seattle?

 
## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one  notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/p/ac3d3a01312/edit.
